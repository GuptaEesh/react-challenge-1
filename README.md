# Zenduty React Challenge 1

## Problem Statement: Open Bunnies

This is a simple website with 5 buttons. Each button should open the image of a bunny. There is a counter below that counts the number of currently opened bunnies. After 2 seconds, the open bunny must be replaced with a different image by manipulating the itemRef inside the useEffect. The image height and width should also be changed to the values provided in the comments. Additionally, the file App.jsx is plagued with errors.    
- You may split this problem into 2 tasks: 
   - Task 1: Fix the bugs and get the up running with no errors. 
   - Task 2: Image manipulation via useRef and useEffect
