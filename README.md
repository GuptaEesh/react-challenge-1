# Zenduty React Challenge 1

## Problem Statement: Open Bunnies

This is a simple website with 5 buttons. Each button should open the image of a bunny. There is a counter below that counts the number of currently opened bunnies. After 2 seconds, the open bunny must be replaced with a different image by manipulating the itemRef inside the useEffect. The image height and width should also be changed to the values provided in the comments. Additionally, the file App.jsx is plagued with errors. Your task is to fix the errors in the code and implement the useEffect explained above.
